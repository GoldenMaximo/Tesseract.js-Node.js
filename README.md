# NodeJS Tesseract Example

Upload an image and see it's text contents rendered on HTML. Simple but pretty cool.

## Built With

* [Tesseract.js](https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/) - JS port of Tesseract OCR
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Web app framework
* [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - Compiler/Templating Engine
* [await-to-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/await-to-js) - Async/Await error handling wrapper
* [pnpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm) - The best package manager

## Inspiration

A friend of mine was complaining about how he had to input some numbers taken from photos manually into an Excel spreadsheet to do calculations and I was like "Hmmm, seems like a job I could automate.". Then I started to play around with some random images seeig if I could do some basic OCR first.

## Installation

*Make sure to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 10.0.0 (or higher) installed.*

1. Clone it or fork it.

2. Once you have your local copy, install its dependencies using either npm:

```
npm install
```

or pnpm:

```
pnpm install
```


## Running

After installed, you can start the application by running it with npm:

```
npm start
```

*This will start the server at `localhost:3000`. (if you didn't change the `PORT` property on `.env`)*
